**<ins>Questions to Answer<ins/>**

1. How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
2. How many Pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
3. How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?
4. Are there any pizzas we should take off the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

**<ins>Insights Derived <ins/>**

1. The number of customers is determined by the number of orders. On average, the shop has 134 orders per day with peak hours occuring twice. The first peak period which is the highest starts at 11 AM and peaks at 12 PM with 6453 orders.The second peak period starts at 4 PM and peaks at 6 PM with 5359 orders.

2. On average, each order has atleast one pizza. The best selling pizza is determined by the total orders for each pizza type.
Bestseller pizza is a combination of Classic and Chicken pizza with the Classic Deluxe Pizza having the highest orders (2416) throughout the year.

3. Total income generated from the sales for the whole year is $817K, with most sales done on the month of July. Although July which had the most sales is in Q3, Q2 made the most sales of the year accounting for 25.5% of the total sales.

4. The decision to take pizzas off the menu depends entirely on the stakeholders. This analysis filters out pizzas with the lowest orders showing that the Brie Carrie Pizza has only 480 orders. Promotions can be done for sometime on the Brie Carrie Pizza to familiarize the customers with the pizza. If sales do not increase for the Pizza or customers do not seem to like it after the promotions, then the stakeholders could hold a discussion on the next move about the pizza.
